# Xash4DS
A port of Xash3DS by MasterFeizz to the latest version of Xash3D-FWGS and an attempt to improve it further from its current state, specifically when it comes to performance and functionality on the original 3DS... cause it's the only one I have. Damn.

Current project list:
- update the underlying Xash3D engine to the latest version of Xash3D-FWGS (right now, commit 8090db2 02/02/2021)
- an actual touch-screen interface that lets you use auxiliary controls easier (right now it's the exact same as ctrQuake)
- better performnace on old 3DS (since it is the only 3DS I own I cry evry tim)
- optimizing the in-game settings menu to be more pertinant to the port and possibly adding some touch screen customization too
- better mod support to hopefully enable a counter-strike port in the near future

Things that *could* happen but I'm not betting on right now:
- turning all the in-game menus into brand new menus that make use of the 3DS touch screen
- generally integrate more of the engine to the 3ds's hardware and homebrew software
- wireless local multiplayer, possibly through download play idfk
- (sorta related to the above) a complete port of CS 1.6 to the 3DS

Thank you to MasterFeizz for [Xash3DS](https://github.com/masterfeizz/Xash3DS) and FWGS for, well, [Xash3D-FWGS](https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d-fwgs).
